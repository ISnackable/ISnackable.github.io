# NOT DONE

## Introduction

The term "rice" is used to describe a person’s unix desktop where "ricing" is when someone is custom their desktop such as the icons, panels, or system interface. When it comes to ricing a tiling window manager though, the ricing of a user’s system becomes much more involved. Basic things such as the panel bar and application launcher must be configured by the user.

The reddit community [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) is a great place to stay up to date on what people are using for their setups.
