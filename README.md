  ISnackable Personal Site

![Personal site preview](./next-web/public/preview.png)

A personal site created with Next.js as the frontend framework and Sanity.io as the headless content management system.

## Introduction

Although this project was created for my personal website. I tried to make it as easy to setup as possible. This only possible because of using a headless content management system and extensive configuration setup in the project.

However, not everything is seamlessly configurable by editing the `next-web/site.config.ts` file yet. (In-progress)
